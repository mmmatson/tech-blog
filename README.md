# Tech Blog

## Description
In this repository I built a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
When you first visit the app, you will see a homepage with existing blog posts. If you are not logged in and click on dashboard or login in the menu, you will be prompted to login or sign up. Once you sign up or login, you will be redirected to the dashboard where you can add new posts and view, update, or delete existing blog posts. If you click logout, you will be redirected back to the homepage.
